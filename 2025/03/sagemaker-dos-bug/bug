## Description

The collab plugin changes the autosave functionality to force save files.
When files have DOS line endings, any text entered is saved shifted to the left.
This is apparent if the file is closed and re-opened, as it appears fine in the editor but is saved incorrectly to disk.

Example of the same change being applied to 2 files, one with dos line endings and one with normal linux line endings:

```
==> example-dos.py <==

import os
import sys

nameKuba = ""
print(f"Hello {name}")

==> example-unix.py <==

import os
import sys

name = "Kuba"
print(f"Hello {name}")

```


## Reproduce


See this PR with a failing test for DOS and passing for Linux.: <TODO>

Also see this notebook: https://github.com/BaukJ/work-snippets/blob/main/2025/03/sagemaker-dos-bug/DosBugNotebook.ipynb


## Expected behavior

Files with DOS line endings should also be saved successfully.

## Context

Reproduced on multiple systems, first found in sagemaker,
